A mod to make Aivu's levelups controllable.

# Changelog:

## 1.2.6

Offical 2.1 release.
Fix for heroism aura buff persisting overlong.

## 1.2.5
2.1 Beta release

## 1.2.3
Fixed for levelups past 20 being broken.
Fix for inability to wear animal companion gloves.
Made ExpandedContent drake companions able to wear them while I was at it.


What it does:
You can now pick what feats and spells Aivu takes on levelup.
Aivu can now equip animal companion specific items if other requirements are met.
Fixes the SFX spam on the heroism aura.


Optional Components:
Aivu's spell list includes the bard list per TT havoc dragons.

Installation and Compatability considerations:
You will need to respec to make use of this mod if you are already an Azata.
An existing Aivu will not benefit from the mod's features and may encounter issues.
Any mod that alters any portion of Aivu's existing progression will be non-functional and may break things - I deep-sixed all of that in the process of making this.

New items and spells should work just fine.


Balance considerations:

Aivu has been nerfed pretty heavily, both casting and breath. This should make that tolerable.

Known Display issues:
The spell access line in the progression shows level 7/8/9 access starting at level 15. Works fine in practice, ignore.
There may be spurrious heroism buff icons in on the character selection box at the bottom - some kind of side effect of the heroism fx fix.

Permissions:
Feel free to borrow the code and integrate into your own mod, just give me a shoutout.
